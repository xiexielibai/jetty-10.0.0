Eclipse Jetty Maven Plugin
========================

The Jetty Maven plugin is useful for rapid development and testing.

You can add it to any webapp project that is structured according to the Maven defaults.

The plugin can then periodically scan your project for changes and automatically redeploy the webapp if any are found.

This makes the development cycle more productive by eliminating the build and deploy steps: you use your IDE to make changes to the project, and the running web container automatically picks them up, allowing you to test them straight away.
